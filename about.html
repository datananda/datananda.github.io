            <p>Madeleine Filloux started working with complex datasets nearly 10 years ago at Brown University where she
                completed an undergraduate honors thesis on identifying disease-causing mutations in the human genome.
                (Incidentally, this is also when she wrote some of her first “real” code and crashed the lab computer by
                writing the output of her Perl program all onto a single line instead of adding line breaks.)
                Documenting the methodology for this thesis work planted the seed for Madeleine’s life goal: to
                communicate information in a way that is both effective and beautiful. This desire led her to a master’s
                degree in information science at the University of Michigan where she expanded her interdisciplinary
                skill set with coursework in human computer interaction, user experience, data science, and graphic
                design.</p>
            <p>Since then, Madeleine has worked with data across diverse domains to deliver insights to a wide variety
                of stakeholders. Her experience includes designing data driven interfaces for industrial software
                applications to make them intuitive for end users, developing interactive reporting for an agricultural
                sales team to optimize their performance and profitability, and creating an aggregated view of an
                enterprise’s marketing data to deliver consolidated and actionable insights.</p>
            <p>Madeleine currently works as a Senior Visualization Engineer at Land O’Lakes, Inc. where she has had the
                unique opportunity to visualize the sustainability impact of dairy farm enteric emissions (a.k.a. cow
                farts). She still crashes her computer every now and then trying to push the boundaries of how we
                represent and communicate information.</p>

            <h2>what is datananda?</h2>
            <p>“Datananda” is inspired by the Sanskrit word ananda
                <img src="./assets/images/ananda.svg" alt="the sanskrit script for ananda">
                meaning bliss or happiness.</p>
            <p>It reflects our desire to transcend the often tedious and repetitive nature
                of ordinary data interactions by creating data experiences that are as engaging and enjoyable as they
                are informative.</p>
